
Ingredients:
4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon (12g) sugar
1 teaspoon (6g) salt
1 packet (7g) active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water
2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil or melted butter (optional, for a richer flavor)
Additional flour for dusting
Instructions:
Activate Yeast: In a small bowl, combine warm water (about 110째F or 45째C), sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active.

Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.

Combine Ingredients: Pour the activated yeast mixture into the well in the flour mixture. Add olive oil or melted butter if using. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon or your hands until a dough forms.

Knead the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for this step.

First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.

Shape the Dough: After the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a lightly floured surface and shape it into a loaf or divide it into rolls or other shapes as desired.

Second Rise: Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or into greased loaf pans. Cover it again and let it rise for another 30-60 minutes until it puffs up again.

Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).

Bake: Once the dough has risen for the second time, place it in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes for rolls or 35-40 minutes for a loaf, or until the bread is golden brown on top and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Cool and Enjoy: Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your freshly baked homemade bread!
